    "\n",
    "Note how in the real world we have to deal with the highly non-trivial problem of **estimating** the vehicle's pose from incomplete and noisy sensor measurements. A Skydio drone uses a combination of IMU (angular velocity and acceleration), barometer (pressure difference with height), camera (feature matching over time) and GPS (if we have enough satelites) to estimate it's pose. We will ignore this (for now, unless you guys are super interested) in this project."

    "### The base classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `QuadrotorDynamics`\n",
    "This module implements the dynamics of the quadrotor and does so with a `step` function. This function will simulate the drone's state one time step into the future based on its current state and the forces acting on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `QuadrotorState`\n",
    "The `step` function will output a `QuadrotorState` that holds the current state of the vehicle. We will go over this in depth, but in short this holds the quadrotor's position, velocity, orientation (i.e. are we rolled, pitched, yawed) and angular velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Controller`\n",
    "This module implements a controller for our quadrotor. It uses a `step` function that takes in the **current** state of the quadrotor (as outputted by the dynamics model) and the **desired** state of the quadrotor (as outputted by the trajectory generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `QuadrotorCommands`\n",
    "The `step` function will output a `QuadrotorCommands` object that holds all of the actuator commands we are supplying, in this case just the four rotor rates. But for e.g. a Skydio drone, you can imagine that there are other things here too, like the motor commands for the gimbal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Trajectory`\n",
    "This module implements a trajectory generator for our quadrotor. It uses a `eval` function that takes in the current time to provide this trajectory, but we can make it as complicated as we like. Examples of trajectories could range from something as simple as a 'hover trajectory' (i.e. constant target of 1m height) to a high-level planner (i.e. a Skydio drone has an optimization-based planner that optimizes a trajectory through obstacles based on user input or its autonomous mission).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `TrajectoryState`\n",
    "The `eval` function will output a `TrajectoryState` objects that holds the desired position and velocity for the controller to follow."

This means I expect the following things in your code:\n",

    "- Clear comments on any line that you think may be non-trivial to a new reader\n",
